# My DSA Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my personal repository for tracking my progress in Data Structures and Algorithms. This project is a collection of my solutions and notes using Java.

## Topics Covered

Here is a list of the topics I've worked on so far. Each folder contains the Java source code for that topic.

- [x] **[Pattern Problems](./patternproblems)**: A collection of 21 common star, number, and alphabet patterns to practice nested loops.
- [x] **[Basic Maths Problems](./basicmaths)**: A collection of simple basic maths programs like count digits, extract digits, reverse a number, palindrome number, armstrong number & find gcd of two numbers (using Euclidean algorithm).
- _(More topics will be added here as I learn them!)_

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Java
